# Swift-by-Strick üß†üçé

Welcome to **Swift-by-Strick** ‚Äî a personal project to master the Swift programming language through hands-on exploration, coding exercises, and mini projects.

This is where I:
- Practice core Swift concepts
- Explore modern language features
- Build a collection of small, working code examples
- Learn by doing ‚Äî and share what I learn publicly
- Develop content that may one day become tutorials or video lessons
